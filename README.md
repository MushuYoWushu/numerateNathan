# numerateNathan
A questionably numerate number reading toy AI. Currently in testing.

This project is dependant on having the mnist training and testing database available in directory to run.
Additionally the quartered and halved tests require that corresponding files of the correct (1/4 and 1/2) proportion
be in directory.

This project additionally requires formatting resources from texttable available to your Python to run. Tested on 3.7.
