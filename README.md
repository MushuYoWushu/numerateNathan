# numerateNathan
A decently numerate number reading toy AI.

This project is dependant on having the mnist training and testing database available in directory to run.
Additionally the quartered and halved tests require that corresponding files of the correct (1/4 and 1/2) proportion
be in directory. Please see the below link for the dataset downloads

This project additionally requires formatting resources from texttable available to your Python to run. Tested on 3.7.
